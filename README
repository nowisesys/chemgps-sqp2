*** ABOUT CHEMGPS-SQP2 ***

** GENERAL:

   The chemgps-sqp2 package contains a daemon, client and standalone program
   for making predictions using Umetrics SIMCA-QP. The programs is based on
   the libchemgps library (should be installed before trying to build this
   package).
   
   The cgpsclt/cgpsd works together and provides a client/server solution.
   Communication is done using local (UNIX socket) and networks (TCP socket)
   connections. 
   
   The cgpsstd (standalone) binary is considered to be a test tool. Use the
   client/server solution for production systems.
   
** PROGRAMS:

   cgpsclt: 
   
      The ChemGPS client. Sends prediction requests to cgpsd. This application 
      can be built without dependencies on libchemgps (and Simca QP) by enable 
      the --enable-foreign option for the configure script.

   cgpsd: 
   
      The ChemGPS daemon. Answer prediction requests from cgpsclt. The daemon 
      is multithreaded and implements a variant of the boss/worker model
      used by i.e. HTTP-servers.

   cgpsstd: 
   
      The ChemGPS standalone program. Works without chemgpsd or cgpsclt. 
      This program function as chemgps-sqp (the old standalone program), 
      but uses libchemgps for its functionality.
    
** BUILD:

   Configure and build (release version for 64-bit Linux):
   
     bash$> CC="gcc32" CFLAGS="-Wall -O2 -m32" ./configure
     bash$> make
     
   Configure and build (develop version for 64-bit Linux):
   
     bash$> CC="gcc32" CFLAGS="-Wall -Werror -O -g -m32" ./configure
     bash$> make
     
   See docs/README.compiler for build notes.
