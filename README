*** ABOUT CHEMGPS-SQP2 ***

** GENERAL:

   The chemgps-sqp2 package contains a daemon, client and standalone program
   for making predictions using Umetrics Simca-QP. The programs is based on
   the libchemgps library (should be installed before trying to build this
   package).
   
   The cgpsclt/cgpsd works together and provides a client/server solution.
   Communication is done using local (UNIX socket) and networks (TCP socket)
   connections.
   
** PROGRAMS:

   cgpsclt: 
      ChemGPS client. Sends prediction requests to cgpsd.

   cgpsd: 
      ChemGPS daemon. Answer prediction requests from cgpsclt.

   cgpsstd: 
      ChemGPS standalone program. Works without chemgpsd or cgpsclt. 
      This program function as chemgps-sqp (the old standalone program), 
      but uses libchemgps for its functionality.
