A simple script to run multiple client (cgpsclt) requests against the daemon
(cgpsd) process.

Example of making 10000 simultanous requests, saving output from each
process to its individual log:

bash $> ./cgpsmulti.sh -m 10000 -i ../../admin/data.txt -r tps -s /tmp/cgpsd.sock -l -b -o logs -ddddd
