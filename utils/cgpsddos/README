** GENERAL:

   As the name suggests this is a tool for making stress test (called DDOS, 
   distributed denial of service) of the predict server (the cgpsd daemon). 
   It loads the server with *lots* if prediction request and measure its 
   response time.

** ROLES:

   The cgpsddos program can take on three different modes:

     * master: control one or more slaves.
     * slave:  answer predict request from master.
     * local:  communicate with cgpsd using a local (unix) socket.

   Both slave and local are multithreaded. The master can't be used with a 
   cgpsddos process in local mode, only slaves can have a master.
   
** SCENARIOS:

   1. Running multiple slaves against the same target (the cgpsd host):
   
      a) Start one slave process on each computer thats part of the DDOS.
         Possibly restricting access using the -a flag.
	 
      b) Start the DDOS attack by running a master connecting to each slave.
      
   2. Testing more than one cgpsd host at the same time (maybe clustered):
   
      a) Start one slave on each host running the cgpsd daemon.
      
      b) Start the DDOS attack by connecting to each slave asking it to use 
         127.0.0.1 as target host.
	 
      NOTE: each cgpsd process must listen on TCP socket for this scenario.
      
   3. Testing a local cgpsd process:
   
      a) Start the DDOS attack running cgpsddos in local mode.
